# PRG from MSA

### One Depth form

### Nested form

## Test data

### Adjacent_markers.fasta

Is here to illustrate a case where adjacent markers cannot be avoided. 
A choice needs to be made between adjacent variant site markers vs adjacent site and allele markers (ie an empty allele record).

## TODOs

[] Google test framework
[x] Debugging mode for writing out useful information using boost
[] Control nesting level
[] Fasta parsing for MSA using htslib?
